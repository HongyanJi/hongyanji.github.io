**Ji, Hongyan, and Sriram V. Pemmaraju.** "[Towards Singular Optimality in the Presence of Local Initial Knowledge.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-60603-8_17)" *Structural Information and Communication Complexity*, (SIROCCO 2024).  

Abstract: In distributed computing, the initial knowledge each processor has about its surroundings can greatly influence algorithmic efficiency, particularly the message complexity -- the amount of information exchanged between processors. This paper highlights the power of local knowledge in distributed settings.

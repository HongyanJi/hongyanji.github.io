## KT-1 CONGEST Model: Exponential-Round Algorithm with Õ(n) Messages

1. **Build a spanning tree**  
   Construct a spanning tree \(T\) in \(\tilde{O}(n)\) rounds/messages.  

2. **Elect a leader**  
   Choose a leader at the root of \(T\). Every node learns its distance from the leader.  

3. **Enumerate possible graphs**  
   With an ID space of size \(n^c\), there are exponentially many possible graphs.  
   Each permutation of node IDs defines a different candidate graph.  

4. **Convergecast process**  
   Let \(E\) be the enumeration of these permutations.  
   The algorithm runs for \(d\) iterations (where \(d\) is the tree’s depth), and each iteration has \(t\) rounds:
   - **Iteration 1:** Leaves send 1-bit signals to their parents indicating whether their neighborhood matches graph \(E_1\).  
   - **Subsequent rounds:** Repeat the check for \(E_2, E_3, \dots, E_t\).  
   - **Iteration i > 1:** Nodes at distance \(d - i + 1\) send bits upward, encoding both their neighborhoods and info received from children.  
   - This way, the root gradually reconstructs the entire graph topology.  

5. **Root learns the graph**  
   After \(d\) iterations, the root \(u_*\) has complete knowledge of the graph.  

6. **Broadcast back**  
   The root then disseminates this knowledge down the tree in another \(d\) iterations, using only \(\tilde{O}(n)\) messages.  

7. **Solve the problem**  
   Finally, each node locally computes the solution from the reconstructed topology.

You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$$$` for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php). -->
